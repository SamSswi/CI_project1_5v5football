        <!-- <p> 
            &emsp;Every year lots of people move to Groningen for studies or work. A big percentage of them 
            are always excited about playing a friendly game of football. However, most 
            of them simply don't have the necessary relationship network to be able to play 
            football from time to time. And even if they do, often getting a group of 8-10 
            people to gather together for a game is difficult to organize and oftenly just an one time thing. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            &emsp;Here at 5v5 Football Groningen 
            we aim to help you overcome this obstacle and pair you up with people just as excited 
            about football as you are. We only ask of you to be accepting and kind towards the others 
            and to contribute paying for the venue renting. We split the amount of money equally between 
            the people participating at the event and it is usually around 6-10 euros per person, depending on 
            the amount of people gathered.
